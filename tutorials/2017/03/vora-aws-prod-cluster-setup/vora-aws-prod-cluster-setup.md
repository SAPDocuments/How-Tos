[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 5: ](Select the `ssh` key pair)]

Choose the `ssh` key pair. If none exists, create one and store it safe for connecting to the instance using `ssh`. Click on **Launch Instances**.

![select ssh key pair](5.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 6: ](Verify instance status)]

View the Instance status in the Console. Wait till the instance **Status Check** shows **2/2 checks passed**. After status check becomes 2/2 checks you can use the public IP of the instance for SAP Vora Cluster configuration and management.

![review instance launch](6.png)



[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 7: ](Check required ports)]

Make sure that the required ports in the edit inbound rules dialog of the instances security group are open.

![open ports](cluster-picture1.png)


[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 8: ](Connect to your instance)]

 Copy the public IP address of the AWS instance from the address bar in Chrome. Click on **Advanced** and accept the certificate.

![AWS security warning](cluster-picture2.png)

Click on **`Procede to <IP address> (unsafe)`**

![AWS security warning](cluster-picture3.png)

Enter the AWS access key id and the access secret key. If the keys are valid, you will be moved to the next step.

![Enter keys](cluster-picture4.png)

Read the End User License Agreement and accept it to proceed further

![EULA](cluster-picture5.png)



[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 9: ](Set up SAP Vora)]

Enter the console password and click **Set up SAP Vora!**. This checks to see if the prerequisites to set up the cluster are met and shows the status if not met.

![Vora](cluster-picture6.png)

Take action on the messages shown in red and click on the button again; for example if port/s are not open, open the security group ports as needed. Refer to the "AWS Step by Step guide to create Security Group SAP Vora 1.3".  `Ambari` server takes a while to start running, so in this case it is good to wait for few minutes. `Ambari` server status can be also checked by doing SSH to the Manager instance and checking the `Ambari` server status.

The steps above are needed only for first-time setup. Later, the console password can be used to access the cluster to log in.

Data node (or nodes) can be added using the **Add Node** button.


[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 10: ](View the cluster management console)]

Click on the **Set up SAP Vora!** button to open the cluster management console. The console shows four nodes (`Manager`, `Master`, `Worker`, `Worker2`) being launched. The **Messages** section shows the status of the configuration.

The host and services status can be viewed in the list of instance cards. For each node card, the top bar shows the status of the node in the cloud and the bottom bar shows the status of the node in terms of `Ambari` and Vora services.

![Cluster management console](cluster-picture8.png)

Once all four nodes are up and running your optimal cluster is ready for use.

For Vora 1.3, the cluster consists of four basic nodes, which form an optimal cluster.  The cluster can be used as-is for loading data. More data nodes can be added as needed.

The four nodes are:

1. Manager: (`Ambari`) + `Vora Thrift server` and `Vora tools`, `Vora Dlog server`
2. Master: `HDFS`, `Vora landscape`, `Vora txbroker`, `Vora txcoordinator`, `vora txlocker`, `Vora catalog server`, `Vora Dlog server`
3. Worker: `HDFS`, `Vora disk`, `Vora Dlog server`, `Vora docstore`, `Vora graph`, `Vora timeseries`,  `Vora v2server`.
4. Worker 2: `HDFS`, `Vora disk`, `Vora docstore`, `Vora graph`, `Vora timeseries`, `Vora v2series`

It is recommended that all the services on these nodes are up and running for proper functioning of the Vora cluster. Data node(s) can be added by using the **Add Node** button.


[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 11: ](View configuration)]

The Configuration process can be cancelled by hitting **Force Cancel**, though it is not advised that you cancel configuration.

In case of configuration failure, retry using the **CONFIGURE** button.

> Note the Resources section on the right has the links to **Ambari**, **Zeppelin**, **Vora UI** (Vora Manager UI) and **Vora Tools**.

![Configure](cluster-picture9.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 12: ](Log in to the Apache Ambari console)]  

Log in to the Apache Ambari console at `http://<public ip of Manager>:8443`. The credentials for Ambari are   `admin:<console password which was set in the setup phase>`.

![Ambari console](cluster-picture10.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 14: ](Vora Tools)]

Vora Tools can be accessed via the link on SAP Vora Console page or at `http://<public ip of manager instance>:9453`.



[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 15: ](Zeppelin)]

Click on **Zeppelin** under resources or enter `http://<publicDNS>:9099` in the browser to open the Vora Manager UI. Click **Login** and enter the login details.

![Zeppelin](cluster-picture15.png)

Click on **Create new note** to create a new notebook.

![Add note](cluster-picture16.png)


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 16: ](Add Data Node or nodes)]

One or more data nodes can be launched using the **ADD NODE** button. The node card appears with flashing green header. This node gets added to the cluster automatically.

![Add nodes](cluster-picture17.png)

![Add nodes](cluster-picture18.png)

 View instance and node details by clicking the respective cards.

![Node details](cluster-picture19.png)

![Node details](cluster-picture20.png)

Click on **STOP INSTANCE** to stop the running instances. Once an instance is stopped, the top of the card shows the status as **STOPPED**.

![Stopped instance](cluster-picture21.png)

![Configure node](cluster-picture22.png)

Similarly, instances or nodes can be started or deleted by clicking the **START INSTANCE** and **DELETE NODE** buttons, respectively. Delete Node is not fully supported in this version if the nodes contain data.

**Note:** Before deleting the node from the console it has to be removed from Ambari.


If the node has been removed from Ambari and if its still available in the cloud as a valid supported node type, the node can be configured by clicking on the configure instance as shown below:



![Configure node](cluster-picture23.png)

![Unmanaged node](cluster-picture24.png)



[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN[Step 17: ](Manage unmanaged nodes)]

 If Ambari shows an additional node currently not being managed by the cluster, it is shown as Unmanaged. Click on the **MANAGE** button and start managing it.


![Unmanaged node](cluster-picture25.png)
